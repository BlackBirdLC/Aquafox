## Description
Aquafox is an independent fork of TenFourFox, incorporating tweaks from InterWebPPC and TenFourFoxPEP. Initially, Aquafox started as a continuation of InterWebPPC, providing precompiled binaries that were up-to-date with the upstream code of TenFourFox. However, since version 2.0, it has diverged from this path and now receives updates separately from TenFourFox.

## Q&A
**Q: Why a fork with a different name? Why not just compile TenFourFox and host the builds at the Macintosh Garden?**  
**A:** The original developer of TenFourFox asks that third-party builds use a different name to avoid support inquiries. This also gives me the freedom to bring my own vision to Aquafox.

**Q: What's the difference between Aquafox and InterWebPPC?**  
**A:** The main difference is that Aquafox is more up-to-date with upstream sources and security. Plus, Aquafox is more optimized. You can think of Aquafox as a spiritual successor to InterWebPPC.

**Q: Why Aqua?**  
**A:** Aqua is the GUI of Mac OS X. To me, Aqua specifically refers to the glossy blue UI found in the early versions before Leopard.

**Q: You mention early versions; does that mean Aquafox works on Panther and earlier?**  
**A:** No, Aquafox only supports Tiger and Leopard. The "Aqua" part is just a name that I think fits it well.

**Q: Are there any plans for extra features?**  
**A:** Aside from ongoing security updates, I’ll keep trying to improve Aquafox wherever I can. If you have any ideas, don’t be shy to let me know!

**Q: How can I help?**  
**A:** Contributing to Aquafox is highly appreciated, and any help is welcome! Whether it's coding, testing, or simply spreading the word, every bit counts. If you'd like to support Aquafox financially, I also accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/thewireless). Your support means a lot!
