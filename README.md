# TenFourFox: Mozilla for Power Macintosh

A port of modern Firefox to the Power Mac, supporting Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, with special features and optimizations for PowerPC processors and AltiVec. _This project is not affiliated with nor supported by Mozilla in any way, and is not an official build._ **PowerPC forever!**

This project is specifically for Mac OS X 10.4+. If you're looking for a browser for Mac OS 8.6-10.3, look at our sister project, [Classilla](http://www.classilla.org/).

Our Github project site houses our [documentation wiki](wiki) and [issues list](issues). For downloads from 24.0 through the current version, visit our [SourceForge download repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tenfourfox/files/). **The most current downloads are always linked on [the main TenFourFox home page](http://www.tenfourfox.com/).**

**If you are an end-user, or otherwise not an official contributor, do _not_ file issues on Github.** Please visit [our Tenderapp support site](http://tenfourfox.tenderapp.com/) and one of our helpful volunteers will assist. Issues opened by end users may be closed as invalid if they have not been adequately vetted.
