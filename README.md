## Description
TenFourFox has been in "hobby mode" since October 2021, and no new official builds have been released since. This doesn't mean that the browser is dead; Cameron Kaiser periodically pushes security updates and bug fixes. Aquafox takes the upstream code from TenFourFox and applies most of wicknix's optimizations found in InterWebPPC.

## Q&A

**Q: Why a fork with a different name? Why not just compile TenFourFox and host the binaries at the Macintosh Garden?**
**A:** Cameron Kaiser states that "If you choose to make your own builds and release them to users, please use a different name for your builds than TenFourFox so that I don't get bothered for support for your work."

**Q: What's the difference between Aquafox and InterWebPPC?**
**A:** For now, it's just a more updated version with a new look. You can see Aquafox as a spiritual successor to InterWebPPC.

**Q: Why not use InterWebPPC instead?**
**A:** InterWebPPC's last release (RR4) is from May 2023 and lacks the August 2023 patchset. This build is also not reproducible as the code in the repository hasn't been updated since November 2022 and produces a broken version of RR3.

**Q: Why Aqua?**
**A:** Aqua is the GUI of Mac OS X. To me specifically, Aqua is the glossy blue UI found in the early versions before Leopard.

**Q: You mention early versions, does that mean Aquafox works on Panther and earlier?**
**A:** No, only Tiger and Leopard. The Aqua part is just a name I think fits it well.

**Q: You speak of precompiled binaries, but I don't see any. Where are they?**
**A:** They'll arrive as soon as they're ready for release. I intend to test builds on the appropriate systems—G3, G4-7400, G4-7450, and G5—before release.

**Q: So we're getting different builds again?**
**A:** You bet.

**Q: Are there any plans for extra features?**
**A:** This is something I will look into after the first release.

## Installation
*Installation instructions will be provided once the precompiled binaries are available.*
